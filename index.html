                <p class="black-box">In this project I learned how to make a use, in a more accurent way, of Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Emums, Collections and Exceptions. 
                    I learned the importance of separating between the user interface and the logical layer, and practice on Development and use of external DII (Assembly).

                <p class="black-box">In this project I learned how to make a use, in a more accurent way, of Classes for implementing Object Oriented Programing concepts. 
                    I practiced the using of Constructors, Enums, Properties, Access modifiers, Modifiers and basic controls and their events.
                    At the end I used .NET WinForms to develop multi-form Windows desktop application.
